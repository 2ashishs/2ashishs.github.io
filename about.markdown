Hi ! I am Ashish S, professionally an Android Developer in India, since past 8 years.
Apart from Java/Kotlin (which I use for work), I also code in Python and C++.
I enjoy making utilities for my team, to ease their development workflow.
I have been fortunate to work for companies with very large user base, >200 Million monthly users (Gaana & Glance).
Gaana was first such project that exposed me to building for such a large user base.
It was a very interesting journey, helping it grow from 30,000 monthly active users (MAUs) to over 200,000,000 MAUs.
Glance was a completely different experience, since I was working on an SDK which would eventually turn into a lockscreen app for more than 200,000,000 users.
Building at scale is a challenging task and you've to be careful to give the users a delightful experience accross variety of devices.
From a developer's perspective you've to ensure that the code does not get too complex, that eventually tech-debt forces you to re-write the app.
When you're working in a consumer facing, product based company, it is likely there are many conflicting stakeholders defining your tasks.
